        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Since 1985, Sprinkles has been one ofthe most-cherished bakers and set the standard for desserts and baked goods. It is a journey from being the neighborhood gem to sweet success. And while we have grown, a few things will always remain: open early and close late, a dollop of buttercream makes everything better, and our mission: make today sweeter than yesterday.</p>

        <p >The story of the world’s most famous bakery begins in 1996 on a quaint, cobblestone corner in the West Village where Sprinkles opened its doors for the first time. The sweet smell of cakes and cookies and pies and pudding tumbled out, wafting down the streets, beckoning all in.
            
            It was time for us to open the cupboards and share our magic with the world. Our neighborhood bakery found its way into new neighborhoods near and far, we wrote cookbooks and helped people all over the world celebrate their precious moments.
            
            And while we have grown, a few things will always remain: open early and close late, a dollop of buttercream makes everything better, and our mission: make today sweeter than yesterday. </p>
